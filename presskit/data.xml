  <description>
    At ZAAN Games, we strive to create polished and compelling game experiences for our players. Games are meant to be fun and bring people together, and that defines the essence of what we hope to deliver. If we can make people laugh together, or make strangers become friends, than we have done our job.

    <history>
      <header>Early Days</header>
      <text>ZAAN Games is a group of four dedicated game developers. We met in 2016 during our first year studying Graduate Game Design and Development at the Rochester Institute of Technology. We spent many months meeting everyone in the program, but slowly gravitated together as it became clear that we shared a common vision of what makes a great game. Some opportunities arose to make polished experiences together, but we all knew we wanted to work on something bigger.</text>

      <header>Capstone and Beyond</header>
      <text>At the start of our second year, we had to separate into groups for a year long capstone project. Immediately we congregated, and ZAAN Games was formed. Our current project, Mytholympics, is a culmination of all our hard work and countless efforts. We have spent many sleepless nights obsessing over every detail to make the game as enjoyable and polished as possible. Every hour of sleep lost is worth it to watch players get lost in the excitement of the game.</text>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZAAN Games is a group of four dedicated game developers. We met in 2016 during our first year studying Graduate Game Design and Development at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Mytholympics began as our graduate capstone project, but has evolved into something much bigger than that. We are very excited to be sharing it with the world.</p>
